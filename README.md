# NewTanks

PROJECT CREATED WITH TANKS ASSETS OF UNITY.

This is my own version using interfaces, events and MonoSingleton, just to test some patterns.

All the scripts of the Original Project were deleted so I started a new code.

The next steps are, improve some behaviors and use Object Pooling and improve the workflow with a global scene to load all the Managers and Controllers as well.
